- Check that the selected member exists in the database
- Verify write permissions for saving QR code files

### Member Management Issues
- Member IDs must be unique - check for duplicates
- Member names are required fields
- Email and phone are optional but recommended
- Removing a member will also delete their check-in history

### Database Issues
- Ensure write permissions in the application directory
- Check available disk space
- Restore from backup if database becomes corrupted
